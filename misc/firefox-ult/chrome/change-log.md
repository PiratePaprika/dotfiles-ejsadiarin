### Change Log:
- `new` Setting `ultima.xstyle.squished` to remove margins and borders, allowing hovering absolute corners to trigger tabs or sidebar display. (similar to `xstyle.squared` but keeping the rounded aesthetic). [#124](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/issues/124)
- `new` Setting `ultima.sidebar.hidden` can fully hide/collapse the sidebar when used with autohide, also allows hovering screen edge when in fullscreen/maximized when used with xstyle.squared or xstyle.squished. [#124](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/issues/124)
- `new` Setting `ultima.OS.notitlebar` for [#122](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/issues/122)
- `new`|`qol` Setting `ultima.sidebar.longer` when using sidebar.autohide the sidebar will be 350px long (bigger).
- `qol` When in fullscreen mode (F11) the navigation bar animation has been overwritten. Smoother transition when handling window control visibility.
- `qol` Setting `ultima.xstyle.lwtheme` given more functionality. Making the vertical tabs and sidebar match the Main Window color.
- `qol` The `doc` folder has been removed from the theme. Cutting source size in half (10mb). View the [Wiki](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/wiki) for all help & documentation.
- `fix` Mac OS titlebuttons display in fullscreen, mistargetted. [#124](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/issues/124)
- `fix` specifying scrollbar styling for webpages with unusual scrollbar utilization (google search). [#123](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/issues/123)
- `todo` Code Miniaturization. position-tabs.css is a mess.
